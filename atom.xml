    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Ebola is a life-threatening virus infection that comes on very suddenly, rapidly progresses to severe toxicity due to dehydration from extravasation of fluids out of circulation. Suffering is sudden and acute; fortunately, survivors cannot remember the ordeal.</p>

<h3>How it is spread</h3>

<p>Ebola is spread by contact with bodily fluids such as blood, vomit, diarrhea, saliva. It also seems to be transmitted by eating animals which carry the virus as a reservoir; fruit bats are implicated in the current West Africa epidemic of 2014, although monkeys, gorillas, and some other animals can be carriers. Objects coming in contact with such fluids such as utensils, cooking materials, cups, glasses, needles, etc. can carry the virus from an infected person. This is why health workers wear garments to ward off any splattering, and gloves to create a barrier for physical contact.</p>

<h3>Treatment</h3>

<p>There is no proven medical treatment. No antivirals are effective against Ebola. Experimental treatments are aimed at enhancing the immune system. The bodys own immune system is capable of combatting the virus, so immune serum from survivors can be used to treat people who are still sick. Monoclonal antibodies are being considered on the same theory. Unfortunately, such treatments are in extremely rare supply.</p>

<p>Supportive treatment is most important and indeed saves lives. Since dehydration is central to Ebola toxicity, providing adequate fluids is frontline in management. When possible, intravenous fluids enhance body function to the point of saving lives.</p>

<p><b>Bedrest is absolutely necessary. Indeed, Ebola sufferers are so wiped out that they can barely even sit up in bed.</b></p>

<h2>Digitized eRemedy Support</h2>

<p>There are a few homeopathic remedies capable of stimulating the body to enhance its own functioning on every level - immune system, circulatory system, energy, organ function, psyche.</p>

<p>If used properly, these eRemedies are nontoxic and may rapidly enhance recovery through improved functioning.</p>

<p>eRemedies are MP3 files that play for only 10 sec at a time. Download speed depends on internet speed, so please be patient. Once the file is downloaded, simply click on the Start/Play button. You will hear just white noise as the homeopathic remedy energy is played in order to stimulate the body to heal itself.</p>
